              <p>On November 4, 1966, during the school day, we had a little unexpected snow. The snow started falling, falling, and falling. By the time it ended, we had more than 13 inches of snow in one school day. It was during the football season, and the boys, coaches, and some fans had already arrived for the game when it was canceled because the field was covered with snow. They decided that the game would be rescheduled after the snow was gone, but boys being boys, they decided to play in the snow. They made very large snowballs, had snowball fights, and built large snowmen all along the field. When the game was finally played the next week, PRP won 33 to 6. Someone from the Valley side had purchased a plastic snowman that they presented to PRP for their victory.</p>
              <p>It did not stop there because some of the boys decided that they wanted to make a papier-mâché snowman to be given yearly to the winner of the PRP/Valley football game, putting the score on the snowman for each game played. Thus the snowman tradition was born.</p>
